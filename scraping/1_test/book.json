        "This review can be found on Amaranthine Reads.Considering how well-written and quick-paced the short story prequel collection The Last Wish by Andrzej Sapkowski was, this was ridiculously disappointing and underwhelming. We have the same characters as was to be found in The Last Wish, and we had their personalities expanded and explored further, but we had none of the excitement or fantasy that was found there.Blood of Elves is very slow and very closed-off. We spend far too much time in one place alone, and we follow conversations at a snail's pace to the point where what they're saying is no longer important but pointless chit-chat. It takes over half the book for us to leave Geralt and Ciri, who have taken up most of the book doing pretty much nothing in one place. The narrator is supposed to be omniscient, but it feels more like first-person narrative with just one or two dips elsewhere to move the rather vague plot along.It's such a huge disappointment because the inclusion of our own folklore and fairytales in The Last Wish was a very good idea and following Geralt as he went about the countryside tackling monsters and demons (which is the job of the Witcher) was exciting, refreshing and kept the stories moving along. In Blood of Elves we meet one monster and little else.It is mostly full of political intrigue, none of which is that interesting, nor does it deviate from the generic fantasy trope of races warring with races, crossing borders and sacking cities. But even then, with the generic fantasy tropes, we barely even get in to them because the characters are too busy having inane conversations whilst, presumably, just standing about being targets.There was, however, a better set of female characters in this, though it was a bit too James Bond-esque how they all seemingly dropped their knickers are the mere sight of Geralt of Rivia. If one can get past this obvious High Fantasy trope and author-projection, we see some female characters that are developed beyond their breasts, but only just.It's a relatively fun fantasy day-out. A quick read, won't challenge you much and will give you a good dose of non-YA fantasy goodness if that's what you're looking for (it's why I gravitated toward it) but it is by no means anything brilliant or ground-breaking. I will, however, finish the series, maybe pick up the other short story collection I haven't gotten around to and possibly play the game that was inspired by it.(It's worth pointing out that this book is the first of a series, despite GoodReads naming it the third. This book is the first full-length novel and makes up the series of full length books, with two anthologies of short stories taking up 1st and 2nd in the series.)",

        "Blood of Elves is chronologically the 3rd entry within The Witcher saga. Whereas previously all the short stories followed Geralt of Rivia working on certain monster assassination assignments, within Blood of Elves he is one of 3 or 4 main characters that we share the minds of. For the novels, you can start here but I wouldn't recommend it. I found that I completely loved the groundwork I'd put in with the previous narratives and then hearing about the past stories mentioned of which I'd already read such as recollecting thought regarding meeting the Golden Dragon and about the macabre events that happened at the downfall of Cintra. It was also an excellent feeling meeting familiar characters (often a bit too spontaneously) that we'd briefly crossed paths with within the previous books. I can't state it enough that this book is so much deeper and more enjoyable if you've read what comes beforehand. The important side characters from the recent stories are more prominent here, most notably Ciri and Yennefer. I'm gutted we don't see more of one of my favourite characters, the womanising troubadour Dandelion. The tale starts at a safe haven underneath a giant tree where Dandelion and his apprentice tell the epic poem of Geralt. We know the stories if we've read the previous entries but the poetry and the action is accentuated for the audience and is more picturesque, beautiful, and heightened in this form. Dandelion is the finest bard in the land who causes the ladies to swoon, the lords to be jealous and the brothel owners to panic! The ensemble of all assembled then discuss what happened at the end of the depicted action. Was Geralt murdered? Did the Child of Destiny, the Princess Ciri escape? Did her and Geralt meet up as was prophecised? It's a really intriguing beginning and sets the action up expertly. Geralt is an extremely famous Witcher whose name is world-renowned. Everyone claims to know him and his exploits but he's not been witnessed in two years so how much is a mere fabrication to attract the attention of revelers in a bar on a weekend evening? In this outing, Ciri, the child of Destiny is essentially the main character with Geralt being more of a shadowy father figure who aids her development as an upcoming Witcher although she also has magical capabilities she does not understand. He is the infamous Witcher, Yennefer is an enchantress and \"will they-won't they\" love interest and although not the biological child of the aforementioned she seems like a perfect mix of arguably the other two main characters. This tale was much deeper than what had come beforehand and as I've previously mentioned I wish to read all of these before the Netflix series is released. The first 30% is mainly focused on Ciri's training at the Witcher halls of Kaer Morten under the watchful gaze of the remaining handful of Witchers but also sorceresses Triss and Yennefer who are both former love interests of Geralt. Geralt does love Ciri as a father would and their relationship is complex, loving in a lack-of-emotion way from Geralt's perspective. He's a complex character as he's been genetically mutated to be a heartless monster killer but he has extreme morals and will not take sides in any sort of debacle. One person's right is another's wrong and he shouldn't take sides and that's not what he has been manipulated for.Honestly, there isn't too much action throughout this novel, but that's fine. This is the foundation of what will no doubt be an exceptional next five books. The main drama is caused by a fire-scarred magical-wielding individual who has an unknown vendetta against Geralt and wants Ciri. Imagine if the Queen on a chessboard was infinitely more valuable and in the eyes of the soon to be warring nations this (even though they don't know if she's alive) 12-year-old young lady has a very important part to play. Child of Destiny isn't a title that everyone is able to flaunt after all. Blood of Elves is very conversation heavy. Sometimes, with players having similar and confusing names it does get a bit over-bearing. Often a conversation will have eight contributors but it doesn't always make it obvious who is saying what so in these scenes I found my mind bouncing around thinking... \"who said that?\" - \"who was that to?\" etc? The vibe and the point of the scene are expressed well but it's not always easy to keep a perfect picture of progression. I loved the majority of the short stories and only a few remain weak and uninteresting in my mind. This seemed like a well constructed but quite safe progression to the novel side of things. It didn't really have an exciting finale. The only event that could be considered as such was a confrontation at the eighty percent mark and then we were gifted a Ciri training session to conclude. This series isn't perfect yet. However, I am really enjoying following this interesting and multi-layered cast. This could go on to being one of my favourite fantasy series. At this point I believe I've only witnessed the tip of the iceberg and Ciri's destiny and the Witcher's influence is amazingly intriguing. I can't wait to read the next one.",

        "This book signifies a sharp departure from the previous two. The first and second ones were collections of short stories mostly told from Geralt the Witcher POV. This time this is a full-length novel with multiple POVs. Actually we only see Geralt's POV in just one chapter - and a shortish one too. In my opinion the book still shows its origins in short story format as the transitions between the chapters are mostly not continuous. Instead they start with a jump in time to give a flashback to connect the events between the previous chapter and current time. As to the plot it is quite easy to outline. The last story of the second book left Geralt stuck with - supposedly - his destiny; namely a child (not his). The poor Witcher was doing all he could and even more to prove that destiny does not exists - at least in his case, only to fail spectacularly. Coming back to destiny's child:oops sorry, wrong picture. It turns out everybody and their brother want to find the poor kid. I mean it literally: it was easier to count the number of named characters of the novel who could not care less about Geralt's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 than the searchers. I also need to mention some of them were so insistent they would not hesitate to leave a dead body (or ten) if somebody happened to be in their way. Now Geralt needs to provide the protection. He also wants to remain neutral in the intensifying political games and this task turns out to be practically impossible unlike disposing of hired thugs. I have some complaints about the book. Geralt is supposed to be a monster hunter first and foremost. Well he hunted exactly one monster in here; none others bothered even to show up. There is something to be said about the evil created by humans being the biggest monster of them all, but I seriously missed a tentacled multi-headed poison-tailed chitin-armored creature waiting for its butt to be kicked by a skilled professional. Now that I finished the book, I cast my mind back and realize that not much actually happened here: a lot of talks, a lot of politics, but by the end most of the characters remained right where they started. Things were brewing, but had not come to boiling point yet. For all the slowness the book has charm. I cannot quite put my finger on it, but somehow I was never bored reading and the read itself was quite fast. For this reason I give the higher rating than I usually do for such book: 4 stars.",

You know what I think, my Little Barnacles? I think Geralt decided to bolt. Why, you ask? Seems pretty obvious to me: the previous installment nearly did him in. First things first, the guy's Monster Slaying Quota (MSQ\u2122) dropped dramatically. Second things second, he was viciously attacked by brutal waves of utter boredom and blah blah blah.

I assume S1 of the show is taken from The Last Wish, which I didn't know to read first!! So I read this one first!! Because it says book 1 but apparently really isn't!! Thx so much for that!!Also this fantasy is old but it made me so happy how inclusive it was? It was refreshingly (shockingly) not gross to women, it talked about menstruation for freaking once, and more pivotal female characters than men. Everyone turning to soft dough in the face of Ciri and the need to love and protect her was basically the best thing ever. Geralt is PUTTY IN HER HANDS. Also Ciri is this feral defiant child who wants to be a Witcher. Yennefer and Jaskier chat for a while and Jaskier legit goes \"Oh I thought you only liked me as much as you like DEATH\" because he still is an endearing pets. Yennefer and Geralt avoid each other because Unresolved Sexual Tension.I'm just sitting here, softly with mouth agape, realising adult fantasy CAN INDEED last a whole book without being monstrous offensive to women. (Wait, brb, need to go beat some other fantasy books over the head with this one.)The style was mostly dialogue; like maybe 70% of this book is pure dialogue. I would've liked more depth to the whole thing, the world and the characters particularly. And it didn't really have a typical plot arc. The ending was more like \"leading up to the next episode\" instead of rising to a climax and exploding into a finale. I feel like we fell into the ending? But I assume the climax encompasses the series as a whole. Which I INTEND TO FIND OUT. I SHALL READ MORE. So not my typical favourite style to read? But I did enjoy it.So basically, if you love the Witcher on Netflix, do read this. So much extra content and small quiet moments to laugh. As well as you learn more about the Witchers order. I know there's also a game, but my TBR just pterodactyl screamed at me. I shall go back to my books, my reading. \ud83d\ude0c",

It is against this backdrop that the story opens. The story of Cirilla, Ciri, the orphaned princess with a mysterious destiny. Of the great struggle between the free kingdoms of the north and their overwhelming imperial adversary. And of the lone mutated witcher known as Gwynbleidd, the White Wolf.And so it begins.After introducing Geralt of Rivia, the White Wolf himself, in a set of stunning short stories, Sapkowski kicks the main story off with a bang as Blood of Elves introduces a somewhat different, yet astounding, fantasy epic.I first read Blood of Elves many years ago now, after having played the first game and read the absodamnlutely amazing short story collection The Last Wish. While I would seriously consider that book a masterpiece of the fantasy genre, this one is more of a traditional series novel. It focuses more on the actual storyline, which is quite fortunately intriguing enough to pull you in and never let go.The world of the Witcher, most recently broadcasted by Netflix after having been stunningly presented in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, undoubtedly one of the most immersive and beautiful video games ever presented to the public, is shown just as enchantingly on the pages of the Witcher books, as they take the reader from the burning city of Cintra to the ancient Witcher fortress of Kaer Morhen and beyond.While it is still relatively unknown by comparison to the giants of the genre (as a result of coming from a non-English-speaking country), I would not hesitate to call this one of the most impressive series in fantasy. And with the rise in Witcher adaptations in recent years, it appears more and more people are finding their way to it.Witcher reviews:#1 The Last Wish#2 Sword of Destiny#3 Blood of Elves#4 Time of Contempt#5 Baptism of Fire#6 The Tower of the Swallow#7 Lady of the Lake#0 Season of Storms",

Breaking the mould of the episodic short stories of The Last Wish and The Sword of Destiny, which follow the adventures and monster killing contracts carried out by Geralt of Rivia, this is about the growth of Ciri and the trials she faces as she attempts to discover exactly who (and what) she is.\u2009After seeing Geralt in action, she wants to be a Witcher too; however, she has the potential to be something much more. Learning exactly what this and why she is so important drives the story forward. \u2009I really like how well described the magic systems are and how each character has their own limitations. Although Ciri is still learning, Geralt and Yennefer are very much aware that she has the potential to be greater than both of them in terms of magic skill and fighting prowess.\u2009Geralt trains her with the sword and Yennefer with magic. Again, we are just beginning to see the possibilities of what she can do. Her elder blood has determined her destiny, she just needs to discover it once she has finished learning. \n\u2009\u2009\u201cRemember,\u201d she repeated, \u201cmagic is Chaos, Art and Science. It is a curse, a blessing and progress. It all depends on who uses magic, how they use it, and to what purpose. And magic is everywhere. All around us. Easily accessible.\u201d\nBecause of the political power Ciri possesses, the world is out to remove her from the existence because she is too powerful a pawn if the wrong hands got hold of her. She is the heir to the mighty kingdom of Cintra, and it is a prize many seek to conquer. As such, Ciri finds herself much sought after for not only the political advantages her hand possesses but also because of her innate abilities. Although the plot is slow moving in this regard, focused only on the perusal of Ciri, I feel like the ground has been laid for some interesting developments over the next few books. So, this is a very good start to a series that I am very excited to read more of. I particularly like how it has built upon the foundations the short stories laid, adding depth to a world that was already very intricate with a large amount of careful world building established. The monsters in all their variety gives the world a bit of a unique feel and when combined with the magic, factions and guilds it has a very strong sense of identity. And this is important because I\u2019ve found that the genre, for all its brilliance, can start to feel very samey when you a read a lot of it. To conclude here though, I'm expecting great things from this series and from Ciri. Short Story Collections 1. The Last Wish - 4.25 stars2. The Sword of Destiny - C/R\nThe Witcher Series\n1.

        "For anyone who's played The Witcher games, or anyone who has not but is interested in dark fantasy, I encourage you to consider reading The Last Wish, which is the first of The Witcher books, an anthology of short stories. Read it before this, and Sword of Destiny too. They're good, and you'll thank yourself for it later when you're not trying to decipher the backstory behind this one. The Blood of Elves is the first full-length novel in the series, and I was not disappointed. It's even made it onto my \"favourites\" shelf.The general concept is that Geralt, a Witcher created through elixirs and brutal mutilation as a child, hunts and kills monsters for pay. This volume is about the child Ciri, who we meet in the short stories of The Last Wish and The Sword of Destiny, and her training in both magic and witching (I don't know if that's what the Witcher craft is called but hey I used it). The other part of this is the brewing war between the Nilfgaardians and the countries on the other side of the river.Character relationships are complex and full of history. They're so tied together by destiny, yet so emotionally stunted towards each other that at some point it's just sad. Poetic and lovely, and not pathetic enough to become angsty and melodramatic. Ciri is kind of the light in the dark, probably to her detriment. She's the one to which Triss's longing for Geralt, and Yennefer's pain over him, is actually put into words. This is the first book in which Triss appears and while I was geared up to immediately feel bitterness towards her, none of Sapkowski's characters end up deserving that. All that said, this isn't a sappy romance love-fest, and is very much story-oriented.Sapkowski's sense of humour is exactly within my tastes too: cynical and quippy, as well as a little mean. Yennefer and Triss both have that sharp tongue that made me laugh out loud a few times, and Ciri is just comical by nature.And here's a less reviewy part and more of a collection of my thoughts. At this point, I'm not sure if Ciri being \"destined\" for Geralt means she's meant to eventually be his partner, or more of a daughter, and I have not played the games to know. Also no spoilers, please. Yennefer's initial resentment towards Ciri would be justified either way, either as a woman with a past with Geralt, or as a woman unable to bear her own children. In this volume at least, Ciri is his ward, and he trains her in Kaer Morhen to be a witcher. Her early training in magic (and how to survive puberty, let's be honest) is carried out by Triss Merigold, whom I adored for being one of the only characters who just said what they were feeling, and later by Yennefer. Yennefer's interactions with Ciri were my favourite part of the book, ultimately. In my opinion, Sapkowski writes the relationships between a young girl and her older female mentors with sincerity and impressive believability.I usually struggle with fantasy not making me truly feel things, but there's plenty of heart torture for me in these!",

        "So yeah, I had high hopes for this series, but it was a total fail for me. I can't remember whose recommendation steered me towards this series, which is probably for the best, because only the strongest relationships could withstand the level of betrayal I feel right now.Like, seriously, I look at all the positivity online for this series, and I just want to scream! I know everyone has different opinions, so I'd expect at least some people to like or love it, but I'm scrolling through endless 4*/5* reviews where no one mentions any of the problems I see in the series.What I Hated (an uncomprehensive list, due to onset of carpal tunnel syndrome): 1) The rampant misogyny:Women are sexualized at every possible point. Triss gets horny when she's mad (page 74) and doesn't mind sleeping with her best friend's man (page 76). Triss also contends, in the name of all women, that their boobies are their pride and joy; and anyone/thing that might inhibit a growing girl's boobies from achieving gigantic proportions will be scorned by them when they are women (page 92-3). Yennefer also makes comments on a nude Ciri's body and how womanly it's shaping up to be. (page 345) It's also stated that women are treated (or, at least, should be, according to the book) like delicate flowers when they have their periods, and must act the part of a proper little lady during this time (pages 88 - 91), by way of feminine mannerisms, dresses, brushed hair and staying indoors and not doing one little thing that anyone could say is manly. Readers like to say women doing anything but being sexy in this series is \"historically accurate\" (in a fantasy novel lol), but woman always had to do housework at home or as a maid, etc. etc, on their periods. How is this the thing the author decided to change about women during any time period? He could've written gender equality, but we get women sitting around like hens 5 days a month. Imagine if the whole female sex just quit working so many days straight, every single month. Like, what???I get told \"Stop injecting politics!\" if I want the women to do anything but be hot. You know, in a series people say they love for its politics. (Also, being a woman is \"a political stance\"? WTF?) Listen up, this is a FANTASY novel. You can be inspired by history, but being rigid in historical accuracy when you're writing fantasy is a choice, not a rule. The author chose not to write modern (at the time of original publication) women. Geralt wasn't written as historically accurate guy; a guy who drinks potions and kills monsters is fantasy, not factually an occupation of the middle ages. Sorry, but screaming \"Middle Ages!\", alone, just doesn't cut it in a FANTASY novel. Defenders could mention these books were written by a guy several decades ago, that they're a product of their time and they read as such. It doesn't totally excuse misogyny in my view, since Robert Jordan and GRRM were writing books around the same period and they wrote awesome women; but it explains it to a minor extent and would definitely further arguments contrary to my opinion. But that would require believing women can be strong and capable, independent of their sexuality. I mean, Geralt isn't prancing around, getting women to do his bidding by being sexy, and it somehow seems like something he could do because all the women find him inexplicably attractive; so why should women exploit their sexuality 100% of the time? Arguing that using something so simple as beauty to persuade enemies and monarchs to do their bidding also undermines the woman's intellect, because she isn't using it. Why does any woman even put effort into learning magic, if boobies are the answer to everything? Why not invest all that tuition money on a magical boob job and avoid the hassle of teachers and grades? Magical makeovers are a thing here, so they could. Writing a good female character is something like showing how beautiful women are more than a pretty face; or writing a plain woman, without attractive features, who gets characters (men) to do her bidding through sly intelligence. \"Woman who flashes boobs every time she needs a favor\" is not good writing, it's wishful thinking.Look, if women are sexy, they're sexy. The issue is that the author won't let the women be anything else. They COULD be capable but plain, but they're not. Yen can't just be a great sorceress, she has to be SMOKIN' HOT sorceress. Triss isn't just Yen and Geralt's friend/ally, she's their SEXY, HORNY friend/ally. Ciri isn't just a child of prophecy, she's a SHAPELY child of prophecy. Brienne of Tarth wouldn't fit in here. I'm not saying beauty shouldn't exist, I'm saying use more creative character descriptions beside HOT HOT HOT. The men are allowed to be ugly. Why am I fighting for ugly equality? See what this book is doing to me????!!!! 2) This series is presented as the story of a monster hunter.Want to know how many times anything odder than a dwarf or elf graces these pages? Zero. Zero times. And even when they do show up, Geralt doesn't even interact with them in any significant way. Geralt himself isn't even here much, even though this series is called THE WITCHER. The most fantastical thing to happen in this whole fantasy novel is a shape-shifting sorceress and a few portals opening and shutting.3) The MC doesn't even have a backstory.Geralt is the MC; there are other POVs, but he's the guy that ties them all together. I am not bothered by multiple POVs, since people seem to get hung up on this. I've read Wheel of Time, A Song of Ice and Fire, and The Stormlight Archive; never confused, loved them all. It's that this is THE WITCHER, but the character who threads everything together is so underdeveloped. We never learn one thing about how he was changed and trained as a witcher, or who he was before he became one (since witchers are made, not born). Geralt doesn't even show up much, and he's not that likable. Why is the guy so important to so many people? He has the personality and charm of a tree stump, and the looks to match (Henry Cavill was way too attractive in the Netflix series). He sucks at his job, too; monster slaying is relegated to the short stories and is all but nonexistent in the novels. The games gave him so much personality that just doesn't exist here. Stories can have mysterious MCs, but they need to give us something, anything. I'd read a standalone if I didn't want character arcs. If the author can't be arsed to write a character background, maybe don't make him the titular character.Overall, this whole book is a story of subpar political maneuvering, lame magic, and some of the dumbest statements about women that I've had the misfortune of reading. It's a fantasy novel, but lacking in fantasy. I just wanted a series where a man kills monsters dammit!",

I had a wonderful time reading this. At no point did I ever feel underwhelmed, think that the pacing was off, or want to complain about the lack of huge battles or epic whatnot. I knew this whole series was a character study first, a social commentary second, and a delightful worldbuilding/epic fantasy extravaganza third. And so, since I already loved the characters, I continued to love the characters, get awed about the full ramifications of the elves, the brewing war that would bring about much more than self-destruction, but the end of so much that was good in this flawed world, and was properly horrified by the other wars that had already happened. One could say that these novels are the effects and substance of massive amounts of Aftermath. And the TV show reflects that. We know things are all about to end. Spectacularly. And it is this over-story that keeps me at the table that is still, primarily, a delicious feast of characters.So I repeat. :) I loved this. I love them. :)",

The magic folk, druids, priests who populate the book never grab me and I just couldn't get into the story. I found myself skimming the book going from Triss' memories to Ciri's training, from events to visions and all along I was just losing interest.Maybe it's me and my own taste. I see a lot of people like this book and I'm certainly glad you found a volume you like. I liked the first book or prequel to this one (The Last Wish) pretty well, but this one just never drew me in. I really don't care for it all that much.I do apologize to you who like this book greatly, as I've noted many times it's simple a matter of taste.",

        "\u201cBlood of Elves\u201d, the third book in \u201cThe Witcher\u201d series, is the first full length novel. I recommend reading the two short story collections first (\u201cThe Last Wish\u201d and \u201cThe Sword of Destiny\u201d) as they are linked together to form the background for this book. It will also give you a feel of the writing style and pacing of the whole series. This is not an action pack, high stakes thriller. This is a very slow, character driven tale where the enjoyment is taken from world-building escapism. I'm not saying it's boring, but if you're use to modern western fantasy stories, you may not enjoy the slow pace. Though there is plenty of Geralt to go around, you\u2019ll realize that this is really Ciri's story. It primarily offers some insight to her childhood after she's taken in by Geralt, showing the early relationships she had with the other characters. The backdrop, of course, is a distinctly sociopolitical tragedy. It mostly sets the scene of two enemy countries, on the brink of war, and how Geralt of Rivia is stuck in the middle, with both countries and numerous independent guilds after him and those he loves. I won't spoil anything but there's a scene that speaks loudly to the futility and toll of war: that very little is gained from killing in the end. Like the previous books, \u201cBlood of Elves\u201d is mostly based on dialogue -- using the characters words or thoughts to set the scene. This does, at times, make it feel a bit rushed and shallow but not enough to detract you from the story. The characters are memorable, the prose is far more sophisticated than in most fantasy, and the world Andrzej Sapkowski created is deeply compelling. I loved almost everything about it: from the sharp dialogue to the complex and multifaceted treatments of racism, sexism, colonialism and other socio-political issues that affect us in the real world. I particularly appreciated the way the book managed to operate simultaneously as serious fantasy and as a tongue-in-cheek deconstruction of the genre's tropes and cliches.  That, of course, is in part because the characters are just ridiculously good! I think Geralt is one of the most fully realized protagonists in fantasy. He's powerful, but reluctant to use his power in a way that might play into the world's terrible politics. He'd like nothing more than to opt-out completely and go about his business killing monsters for coin, but he can\u2019t, and is inevitably dragged into affairs of war and peace. He's quiet, yet thoughtful; violent yet only hesitantly so; hard yet shows a greater capacity for empathy than anyone else in his world.The powerful enchantresses he is romantically involved with, Yennefer of Vengerberg and Triss Merigold, are no less compelling. Any scene with Yennefer is pure gold! She's prideful, antagonistic and fierce. Yet, beneath the hard exterior -- undoubtedly caring and sympathetic--exactly the kind of complex, independent female character that male writers often have trouble writing. Her tortured relationship with Geralt is one for the ages, and works because she is his equal in every way.  \u201cBlood of Elves\u201d serves more as an introductory chapter to the overall story arc, and while it isn't the most exciting or plot driven story I've read -- it excels in delivering interesting, fleshed-out characters that you can't help but want to learn more about and sets the stage for the rest of the series. The ending is not an ending at all, but more of a lead into \"A Time of Contempt\u201d. Patience is required! If you ever want a more realistic approach to a fantasy world where politics of the realms have a larger impact on the world than a single character -- \u201cThe Witcher\u201d is worth the effort.",

        "Check out my review for Blood of Elves by Andrzej Sapkowski on Grimdark Magazine here: Grimdark MagazineBlood of Elves, the first \u2018proper\u2019 book in the tale of The Witcher, is a story of extreme training, bards songs and of course, swords. You\u2019ll want to read this and the previous two instalments before you commence your journey into Netflix\u2019s The Witcher. \u201cWhen you know about something it stops being a nightmare. When you know how to fight something, it stops being so threatening.\u201dThe 3rd instalment into The Witcher moves away from the prior collections of short stories, and shifts into gear for the grand arc that is sure to come in the remaining 5 instalments. Where The Last Wish and Sword of Destiny focused on monster-slaying contracts, Blood of Elves has character development at the fore. It was my main gripe with the previous two stories, how there did not seem to be an over-arching scheme that would link everything together. I highly suggest that you begin your journey into the realm of The Witcher with The Last Wish, and then Sword of Destiny as they subtly introduce a vast range of characters. I was pleasantly surprised with the return of minor characters that had quirks and personality enough for me to distinctly remember them. \u201cTo be neutral does not mean to be indifferent or insensitive. You don't have to kill your feelings. It's enough to kill hatred within yourself.\u201dIt is through Geralt\u2019s interaction with other characters where the books come alive. The vast variety of dialogue sequences and subjects allows everyone to have their own voice, pardon the pun. Their voices and styles are distinct, if a lot of the time very wordy, which I will blame on the translation\u2026maybe.If you\u2019ve played the games, you\u2019ll notice lots of references the makers made in honour of the books. Particular scenes, such as the training of a young \u2018Witcher\u2019. There is a surprise as Geralt is not the only POV. The most notable addition is Ciri\u2019s side of things, which I wasn\u2019t keen on at first (everyone always wants more Geralt,) but in the end really enjoyed it. She is a character that is growing on me and I am really looking forward to seeing where the story takes her.\u201cI know you\u2019re almost forty, look almost thirty, think you\u2019re just over twenty and act as though you\u2019re barely ten.\u201d The world building is solid, and gives the impression of a vast and well thought out world, from the Witcher haven of Kaer Morhen to the busy city of Novigrad. Characters that drift between places are met and so are characters that are key parts of regions. I\u2019d have loved a map to go with the various names, which would have given me a real scope of the world, but I used my knowledge of the games (which is albeit probably slightly different to how Andrej Sapkowski imagined the world).I still managed to find the examples of a gender imbalance, which unfortunately I\u2019ve come to expect from a Sapkowski book about the Witcher. Geralt is a good man, and someone who tries to treat everyone equally, but there were still instances in the general writing of it. Still, I was pleasantly surprised with Ciri\u2019s POV and really enjoyed her portrayal.Now one thing I need to say is that I was desperate for more sword and sorcery. Geralt is one of the coolest guys and he has some really cool swords and I really wanted some cool swordplay and casting of signs and monster heads to go flying and\u2026 I could go on for a while. I would have enjoyed some more action. And some more classic fairy tale re-tellings. There was certainly enough talking in Blood of Elves, there could have been a few more instances of bloody fighting and some twists and turns. Hoping I\u2019ll get my silver sword fix in the next instalment, Time of Contempt! \u201cNight and day the streets resounded with music, song, and the clinking of chalices and tankards, for it is well known that nothing is such thirsty work as the acquisition of knowledge.\u201d3/5 - Hoping for something better, but still enjoying what I received. This lukewarm dish is warming up and I have high hopes for the continuation of The Witcher Saga. The preparation for Netflix\u2019s The Witcher is enjoyable, and I am sure will sweeten the TV show and Henry Cavill\u2019s lovely wig. More swords next time, please! Igni!",

They all lost all sense at the sight of Geralt, falling head over heels for him for no apparent reason because he has about as much personality as a stick. And the author appears to understand nothing about girls' puberty and periods and should really stay away from writing about them. Why should the use of magic cause cramps for women? What was the point of that? And why should they not exercise when they have their period? I ended up putting this down and reading other books and just struggling to finish it.It was just about getting good at the very end. It was just a generic training montage with Yennifer teaching Ciri the way of the magicians but the magic system was interesting.The translation is good but even that can't fix the fact that it's just a book about politics, people arguing and jockeying for power. Add in the lack of decent female characters and this is just not for me.",

        "This is the first full-length novel in the Witcher universe. The previous two books, that I've read in January, were collections of short stories.Ciri is now with Geralt and at the Witcher settlement where she is trained despite being a girl. And I celebrated her fighting windmills, carrying a sword and turning from damsel-in-distress-with-a-twist to a determined warrior-to-be who won't take shit from anyone.The problem is that she's not just a princess whose fate is intertwined with Geralt's - she has powerful magic her current companions can't teach her anything about. So the enchantress Triss is asked to help. But her power has limits so the trio soon sets out to get Ciri to a save place where she can train all of her skills while Geralt goes off wandering again.Along the way, they encounter the political problems of this world: the races are as good as at war with one another, sometimes they even kill their own kind for being too friendly to another race.So we get to marvel at old ruins of elven palaces and weep for the story of their demise. We witness dwarves killing each other. We're also fighting alongside Geralt and his convoy, experience first-hand the horrors of war (burnt corpses, tortured creatures, death and fire). As a contrast, we also get to know about places such as the University of Oxenfurt that shows us a different aspect of this world that is no less important.I was also very pleased that there weren\u2019t only Ciri and Geralt (plus a few other players) but that we got a bit more of Yennefer as well when she became Ciri\u2019s teacher. Yep, I really like her.Other than that, we sadly didn\u2019t get too many creatures (read: monsters) as Geralt had no time to follow his original profession as monster hunter since everyone and their mothers were after Ciri and he needed to keep her safe and her whereabouts secret.There was a bit of a lull in this book from time to time. The short stories got to the point much more quickly, of course. However, we trade the snappiness of the action for beautiful worldbuilding. Some details might seem random at first but the author has strewn them about purposefully and picks up the strands later to weave a gorgeous albeit grim and dark tapestry of a world where magic and fantastical creatures still roam the earth and every breath could be your last.In the middle of such a turmoil, the author asks important questions such as the meaning, purpose and consequence of neutrality in a conflict. Or the motivation of different factions, the complex aspects that often have to come together in just the right way to spark war. How and why some individuals are trying to prevent it. The devastating results and how to pick up the pieces afterwards.Some elements resonated more with me than others, as is to be expected. One such element suckerpunched me right at the beginning of the book when Triss contemplated collective responsibility, guilt for something that happened long before one\u2019s birth, and refused it. I happen to be a person supposed to accept such a collective responsibility and I, too, refuse it. Thus, there was an instant connection I hadn't expected. Just one more example of deep thoughts being implemented into an action-fantasy story.Yes, this is fantasy. But it is SMART fantasy. Very well written in a wonderfully detailed as well as fast-paced way that has only few equals.I sure as hell hope that the second or any subsequent seasons of the Netflix adaptation will feature this story or aspects of it at least. We've seen the motives being addressed in season one already but I definitely want to see the Witcher settlement / school (and more Witchers).",

I believe I did a bad decision when I started the series with The Last Wish. May be I have to read the novels after I read all the main books. Long story short: I picked The Last Wish after I hear Daniel Greene ( my link text )on you tube that he is reading The Witcher and is so good I have to try, but I did not like the book. Most of the time we have similar tastes and exactly the things I find annoying in a book, he also highlights them, so it surprised me a little that the book didn't captivate me. After Cavil got the role of Geralt I have to see the tv show, so in my characteristic style I cannot see a movie if it is made after a book until I read the book, and here I am!Blood of Elves I like it a lot. I really loved the characterization. Both in our main characters Geralt of Rivia and Ciri, and all their supporting characters. The dynamics of relationships between characters in this book are complex and full of history. brought together by destiny, but emotionally stunted towards each other. Geralt, Yennefer, Triss, and Ciri all have emotions that will captivate your heart and you will root for them in different ways. What I love about Yennefer and Triss is that they have both a sharp tongue, that \"woman in control\" attitude I like to see more in feminine characters. This book has a perfect balance between action, dialogue and description, and when conversation take over, is so well written that does not fill pages just for the sake of making the book thicker, but simply provides information for the reader to understand this world. It was a struggle for me and a little confusing because of the similar names, and when it\u2019s not entirely made clear who it talking .So, overall, I really really enjoyed the read and want to certainly continue the series.",

        "This is the first full length instalment in The Witcher series, but does follow from two prequel short story collections The Last Wish and Sword of Destiny.Geralt of Rivia is a Witcher, a magically-enhanced individual paid to slaughter the beasts that prey on the humans of the land. His current task involved the transportation and ensured safety of Ciri, the child of his destiny and the individual in which his future lays. Enemies lie on every side of them, keen to either abduct Ciri for their own evil gain or abolish the threat she poses altogether.Despite this being the first series instalment, I can't imagine finding much enjoyment or understanding without previously having read the prequel short story collections. They both contain a multitude of individuals that also feature here and do the job of explaining their nuanced relationships and interwoven backstories.Although this is titled the Witcher series, not much Witcher antics actually occurred and Geralt himself did not receive the majority of page time. This was dedicated the Ciri, the child of destiny. The reader largely follows her growth as a magical individual, first under the care of Geralt and then with his former-maybe-also-future love interest, Yennefer. Whilst Ciri remained a favourite of mine I was always keen to discover where Geralt was and found the pacing, when following all of the characters, a little slow. My interest remained high and I am looking forward to discovering where the story will continue, after the slight cliffhanger this closed on.",

I do plan to get to The Last Wish eventually, which like, might be a while.Like I said, it was a success and I did really enjoy it, however, I do also have some criticisms and other things that detail to personal preference that means that this book is a 4 star instead of 5. One thing that I did really enjoy was all the characters and the many interactions that we saw between them. There is lots of dialogue in this book, and a lot of descriptions, which is very different for a fantasy novel, though since this is a translated work, and I don\u2019t know anything about Polish Literature, it may be something more common in Polish works compared to English fantasy, which is basically known for having super long descriptions about everything while being slow. This book instead was honestly the opposite with minimal descriptions and a lot of dialogue, which truthfully, I didn\u2019t mind that much, since it was written really well and some of these characters are plain awesome. Now, when I initially saw these books, I was quite surprised at how little pages it had for an Epic fantasy, but now that I have read this book and have noted that there aren\u2019t that many descriptions, it makes a lot more sense, as most fantasy authors would have made this easily a good 600 pages.There isn\u2019t a map in this book, which I understand, not every author likes a map in their book, yet it also mentions lots of places geographically that I had no idea where they were in relation to the rest, yet thankfully, due to the internet, I did spend some time staring at the map Netflix made for the show, which honestly, is such a beautifully done map(if anyone\u2019s wondering, I have not seen the Netflix adaptation). I did like the world building in this book and at how the author gave us some background history to the current situation and hints of political intrigue as well, though there was not a lot of this. I would have liked to have learnt a bit more about each individual country and the culture behind it. We did get some decent information on Cintra and Nilfgaard, but would have liked a bit more on some of the other prominent nations in this book such as Redania or Kaedwen. I know that this is book 1 and it is very likely that we will get more worldbuilding in the near future.It was interesting at how this book was laid out, since instead of having a direct goal or point of interest for the characters, each individual chapter was more like a short story of its own that joins to together to form the book. There are some chapters dedicated to Ciri and her training, yet there are other chapters which does not feature her at all and instead focusses on another plot line that has little relevance to her, even by the end of the book. Another thing to note about the ending is that there is no pay off at all, and largely consists of conversations and simply leads into the next book instead of the usual action packed ending of more traditional fantasies, which I found interesting as in reading a translated work, it sort of shows that different cultures have different ways I suppose in writing the same genres that I know and love, even though it is based roughly on the same ideals. This is definitely a book that sort of highlights the transition in a way between traditional and modern fantasy, since while it features elves and dwarves, there are also lots of cooler newer aspects, the Witcher and world itself to mention some of them. I mean, overall, I thought that this was an awesome book and I can\u2019t wait to start book to to see where my characters are off to in the uncertain times that they are in. 8/10",

        "After two collections of short stories, I\u2019ve finally arrived at the first novel in The Witcher series. Though this is marked as book #1 in many places, including Goodreads, I really can\u2019t imagine diving into this world without having some background knowledge and context for the events occurring. Whether that\u2019s from The Last Wish and Sword of Destiny, the several video games or the first season of the Netflix show, I wouldn\u2019t recommend having Blood of Elves be your introduction to Geralt, Yennefer and Ciri.For one thing, there\u2019s so many time jumps! The chapters are massive, so they\u2019re broken up with a few line breaks, but you really have no idea what time or place Andrzej Sapkowski is going to pick up at. I wish that he was more clear, but at this point part of reading a Witcher book is being confused halfway through it until whenever Sapkowski decides to explain what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s just part of the journey! We\u2019re all Dandelion, wandering around, singing about earning coins until Geralt comes swooping in to save the day.Speaking of, Dandelion (Jaskier) is much less insufferable this time around. I take back my wish from my last review that something would eat him. And only two (!!) women completely lose control of their faculties and throw themselves at Geralt for no discernible reason. It\u2019s still ridiculous, and so obviously written by a dude, but at least he didn\u2019t leer at any rogue nipples this time around.The highlight in this book comes in the last chapter, where Ciri and Yennefer are sequestered alone with one another. They are a riot and have some of the best interactions of the series. Solely for that selection of 60-odd pages I will give this one five stars, though the rest was pretty solid as well. This book sets up a lot of events that are going to happen down the road, and I\u2019m highly anticipating those future payoffs!",

        "Blood of Elves expands beyond the introduction of Geralt of Rivia and brings forth a different level of worldbuilding into the story in a character-driven narrative.While this book is technically the start of the main series, I wholeheartedly recommend reading the prequel short stories in The Last Wish and Sword of Destiny first. A lot of references to past events in Blood of Elves were covered in those two books - important past events. I even found myself doing a quick read of some of those short stories to jog my memory since I had read them a year ago.This novel, however, does not have the typical fantasy story structure with a climax at the end. I felt that Blood of Elves was like a long Prologue of sorts dealing with two key plotlines. The first was centred on Ciri's training; initially by the witchers in Kaer Morhen, and then by Yennefer in the Temple of Melitele. The second was a highly political and war-focussed narrative around the invasion of Nilfgaard, the tenuous peace amongst the different races, and the ominous prophecy by the elven Seeress, Ithlinne Aegli aep Aevenien.\n\n\n\n\"Verily I say unto you, the era of the sword and axe is nigh, the era of the wolf's blizzard. The Time of the White Chill and the White Light is nigh, the Time of Madness and the Time of Contempt: Tedd Deire\u00e1dh, the Time of End. The world will die amidst frost and be reborn with the new sun. It will be reborn of the Elder Blood, of Hen Ichaer, of the seed that has been sown. A seed which will not sprout but will burst into flame. Ess'tuath esse! Thus it shall be! Watch for the signs! What signs these shall be, I say unto you: first the earth will flow with the blood of Aen Seidhe, the Blood of Elves\u2026 \"\n\nShoehorned into this overarching story was also the fact that someone is desperately looking for Ciri. For now, I still don't know what it meant for Ciri to be the 'child of destiny' aside from her heritage and her unique powers. And this is something that I am very eager to find out. Blood of Elves focussed a lot on Ciri. Thankfully, I enjoyed her characterisation. The interaction between her and Yennefer in the last chapter was one of my favourite parts in this novel, as well as any of Ciri's scenes involving Geralt. And of course, any of Geralt's own POV scenes. Unfortunately, the latter was not plentiful enough in this book for my taste.As compared to the previous two books, the worldbuilding in this instalment steered away from the 'monsters' theme (which I loved) and more towards the political landscape (which I'm not so fond of). Frankly, it was downright confusing, and the learning curve was insanely steep. The various lands and their respective rulers and alliances, etc. etc. completely confused me. There were so many names - difficult to pronounce and with the most unusual spelling - that it was hard to keep track of. The absence of a map was also sorely felt, especially since I was not exposed to the video game.All said, it was still an enjoyable read and was often quite humourous too. It helped that I've already developed an investment in the characters, especially in Geralt and Ciri, and their father-daughter-like relationship. Geralt is such a complex character, and not given to any outward display of emotions but you know it's there, simmering and roiling under the surface. I even started to like Yennefer a bit more from her scenes with Ciri at the end of the book.Gorgeous alternate book cover of Geralt and Ciri by Niki Vaszi (https://www.artstation.com/nikivaszi)The Witcher series is not a particularly original or unique fantasy story, but there is something quite refreshing in its take on 'sword and sorcery'. This series is definitely worth checking out if you're a fan of this fantasy subgenre.You can purchase the book from Amazon | Book Depository (Free shipping worldwide)You can find this and my other reviews at Novel Notions.",

Some of my favourite scenes and the most humourous happened between the sorceress Triss Merigold, Ciri and the other male Witcher\u2019s in the keep.This book focused on Geralt and Ciri, with threat of war, unrest,politics and destinies interwoven. This book especially focuses on Ciri\u2019s training and I loved her scenes with Yennefer and how they get to know each other.Also, Yennefer\u2019s first appearance in this book was so bad ass- I loved it!Of course in this book Geralt has accumulated MORE enemies and this book was less about him fighting monsters, but more fighting those who wish to kill him and get to Ciri, the child of prophecy. This definitely built up to the next book which will hopefully throw out characters together once again and I can\u2019t wait to read it !",

        "4 of 5 stars at The BiblioSanctum http://bibliosanctum.com/2015/07/01/a...I remember being thrilled when I discovered that The Witcher saga by Andrzej Sapkowski was available in audio format. As a big fan of the video games which were adapted from this series, I was of course interested in reading the books, but as waiting for the English translation from its original Polish already required a bit of patience, I never really dared hope that the audiobooks would be coming too.As of this writing though, English versions of The Last Wish, Blood of Elves are available in audio with The Time of Contempt coming soon. In time it would be amazing to see the entire saga get the same treatment, and not least because I think the books stand up quite well in this format. They\u2019ve chosen a very good narrator in Peter Kenny, whose voice lends itself perfectly to telling this type of story. His performance style can be described as almost \u201cbard-like\u201d, which really highlights the book\u2019s opening scene in which the charming minstrel Dandelion holds a crowd rapt by reciting the heroic exploits of the legendary Witcher, Geralt of Rivia.As a Witcher, Geralt is part of a society of enhanced fighters and monster-slayers. Taken as children, they are subjected to intensive training and a ruthless regimen of alchemical and mutagenic compounds intended to alter their physiology and prepare them to hunt their prey. Although Witchers are meant to remain neutral in matters of politics, Geralt has taken an orphan princess named Ciri into his protection, hiding her from spies and assassins sent to find her. He believes that she is the prophesied child meant to bring great change to the world, not only because of her royal heritage but also because of the magic that flows in her veins \u2013 the blood of elves.The narrative follows Geralt and Ciri on various adventures. The young princess, taught sword fighting and other martial arts by Geralt and other Witchers, learns about supernatural monsters and how to kill them. She also begins training in magic with the sorceress Triss Merigold. But on the way to a school were Ciri will receive a more normal education, the party encounters all kinds of obstacles, including illness, encounters with monsters, Scoia\u2019tael ambushes, and attacks from Nilfgaardian agents. As Ciri\u2019s magical potential becomes more powerful, Geralt realizes he will need the aid of some friends and unexpected allies in order to continue protecting and training her.It\u2019s important to note that while Blood of Elves is advertised as the first of the series, it is technically preceded by two short story collections in terms of chronology: The Last Wish and Sword of Destiny. It\u2019s not really necessary to read either before tackling Blood of Elves, though it would probably help fill in a lot of the background information. The book is very heavy on world-building elements, and while Geralt is arguably the star of the series, he doesn\u2019t appear as much as you would expect. His character is often seen through the eyes of others, or is talked about in others\u2019 perspectives. On top of this, the switching points-of-view and various flashbacks may make this story feel confusing and disjointed. Having read The Last Wish as well as played The Witcher video games might have familiarized me with a lot of the characters and the setting because I managed to follow without getting too lost, but it might pose a challenge for readers going in blind. It\u2019s probably worth considering The Last Wish as a starting point instead.In spite of this, the plot was wildly entertaining. One can never be sure how much is lost in translation, but there is some humor that managed to come through. Also, the author sometimes employs an interesting storytelling style where entire scenes are almost completely made up of dialogue, and it often amazed me how much of the atmosphere and plot came through via conversation alone. Again, this is where Peter Kenny\u2019s narration shines, because someone less skilled with differentiating voices would probably have a lot of trouble pulling off these scenes.Sapkowski definitely has a flare for writing adventure and action, even experienced through the lens of translation. The pacing is strong, despite various breaks in the plot to focus on character development or to explain the political situation. The highlights were of course the scenes of Geralt fighting off enemies and monsters. The book does leave us hanging a bit, but this is after all the first full-length novel in the series and does spend a lot time establishing the premise and setting things up nicely for the next one, The Time of Contempt. I\u2019ll have to seek that out very soon.If you\u2019re a fan of the games and can\u2019t get enough of Geralt of Rivia, I highly recommend these books. They could also be good for fantasy readers looking for a somewhat different kind of sword and sorcery. The translation is decent, but what I was really impressed with was the way the narrator read for this audiobook. Can\u2019t wait to experience the rest of the series.",

I read The Lats Wish then as recommended by a friend and then watched the show which I enjoyed. I have never played the video games so I don\u2019t know much about the story apart from what I have watched and read. I read Sword of Destiny after that but never got to continue the series. I was hesitant because some friends told me the short story collections are the best, some also told me the translation is not the best and the book may not be the easiest to read. I kind of lost interest then and kept procrastinating. This week, I was on the verge of a reading slump and picked up two books which I knew I should have liked but did not so I picked up this book on a whim and found myself flying through it. I do agree that the short story collections are better but I think that the low expectations really helped me to enjoy this one.The first thing that surprised me was the length of the book, I have the box set of the first three books in the series but I never bothered to check the font and the page count and I just discovered that the books are not that big and the font was kind of big which made me even more excited to read it. I always enjoy books more if I have a visual representation of the characters whether that is from TV series or fan arts or video games and the Witcher has all of these to help build the characters. The story follows Ciri mainly through her training with the Witchers first and then the Magicians.The writing is good, I mean we are talking about a book written in 1994 and it still feels \u201cfresh\u201d. The female presentation is not the best -still better than the first two collections books- and I am just used to this fact by now. The translator (Danusia Stok) did a pretty good job at translating the books and making English seem like the language they were written in. I saw that the rest of the series has a different translator and I hope he keep up with the quality here.\n\n\u201cTo be neutral does not mean to be indifferent or insensitive. You don\u2019t have to kill your feelings. It\u2019s enough to kill hatred within yourself.\u201d\n\nThe characters are well written, I am talking mostly about Geralt, Ciri, Yennefer and Dandilion here because I already know these characters. Some of the secondary characters are also well written but some of the names were complicated and long and similar and all introduced together which made them very hard to follow for my brain. That also includes a lot of country names and their borders and without a map, I can\u2019t say that I absorbed everything as I am supposed to.The world-building is good, I would have preferred more action, more magic and monsters and fights but this was mostly a political book with a chase and run sub plot. It also felt like the whole book is a set up for the rest of the story and the ending doesn\u2019t feel so grand because of that. But if I am right and the rest of the books are more dynamic and have a more defined plot, then I am not complaining.The pacing is kind of average, I expected something slower but due to the length of the book, it was not that slow. I was also surprised by the length of the chapters as the book is 400 pages long with only 7 chapters. I am a fan of short chapters in general but the length did not really bother me here.\n\n\u201cWe are the children of Mother Nature. And though we do not respect our mother, though we often worry her and cause her pain, though we break her heart, she loves us.\u201d\n\nSummary: This whole book felt like an introduction to the main series. The writing and translation exceeded my expectations. The characters are good and the world building is okay. There were info dumps with too much names and no maps or visuals to help define them though. I think there are many questions that were left unanswered and I want those answers soon which means I will be picking up book two next month!",
